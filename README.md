# Course Party Game (Skeleton)

This repository is an **empty Unity project skeleton** matching our agreed architecture and scene layout.
Use it as a clean starting point for GitHub so each teammate can work on their part without merge chaos.

## Scenes (placeholders)
- MainMenu
- PlayerSetup
- Dealer
- KaijiRPS
- Results
- FinalStandings

> Unity will recreate `.meta` and import settings on first open.
> Add real scenes/assets later; these placeholders are here to keep structure.
